    <h1>Iván Ricardo Taimal Narváez</h1>

    <h2>Who are?</h2>
    <p>I am engineer in electronics and telecommunications from University of Cauca. <br>
        Nowadays I find myself entertained working with microservices on EKS AWS using <br>
        Go and hexagonal architectures.
    </p>

    <h2>Why am I a good option?</h2>
    <p>I have worked on several projects from concept to completion,<br>
        gaining determination and experience for solving problems.<br>
        I am able to strategically design well-architected distributed <br>
        systems that are scalable, resilient, efficient, and fault-tolerant in cloud environments.<br>

        Guided by my hobbies and my skills, I was been focused on Front-end development<br>
        and application architecture as a Full Stack JavaScript developer.<br>

        Always trying to capture and transmit in my work the dedication and love for what I do.
    </p>
